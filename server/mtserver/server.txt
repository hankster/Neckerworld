Example code from my Multithreaded Work Queue Based Server in C++ blog.

Build
Get the threads code.
Get the work queue code.
Get the TCP sockets code.
Place the mtserver, threads, wqueue and tcpsockets directories at the same directory level, e.g. ${HOME}/src/mtserver, ${HOME}/src/threads, ${HOME}/src/wqueue and ${HOME}/src/tcpsockets.
cd to ${HOME}/src/mtserver.
Build the test client and server applications by running make.

RunPermalink
First run the server listening on TCP port 9999 and with 5 consumer threads like this:

$ ./server 5 9999 localhost
thread 4426719232, loop 0 - waiting for item...
thread 4430274560, loop 0 - waiting for item...
thread 4429737984, loop 0 - waiting for item...
thread 4428664832, loop 0 - waiting for item...
thread 4429201408, loop 0 - waiting for item...
Next run a series of clients like this:

$ client 9999 localhost; client 9999 localhost; client 9999 localhost
